// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*

  1.constant :O(1) simple code  not complex you can wrote internal just var and for loop search in same parameter 
  2.logarithmic : O(log) contain if statment (edgecases )  and some of recusion 
  3.linear :O(n) contain one for loop  and evaluate simple function
  4.quadraticL: O(n2) contain Nested for loop and solved more complex than linear
  5.exponential : contain more and more edge cases if statement  and for for loop and recarion
