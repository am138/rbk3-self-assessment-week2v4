there is several typres of time complexity in algorithmic:
1- O(1):'forexample' if we reached to an element inside an array directly without itereating throw
all elements we used big O(1).
2- O(n):'forexample' if we iteareted throw all elements in an array to search for some elements we want to
emplement somthing on it.
3- O(n)2:'forexample' if we iteareted throw all elements in an array to search for some elements we want to
emplement somthing on it and then iteareted another time we iteareted throw the same array we used O(n)2.
4- log O(n):'forwxample' if we search for one element in an array and we searched part by part from the array 
like the tree way when we cut the array to two parts and and if we did not find the element we leave this 
part and move to the other part.
