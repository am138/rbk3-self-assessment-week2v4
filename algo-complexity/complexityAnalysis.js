// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.

/*
O(n) time comlexity or linear time comlexity the best case is 0 but the worest case is n .it happens when we loop inside one loop
O(1) time comlexity is fixed and always equals 1 
O(n^2) the time comlexity may be a value betwwen 1 and n^2 the worest case is n^2  . it happens when we loop inside two  loop
O(log(n)) time comlexity is a value beteen 1 and log(n) time comlexity is incresing when n increased but not like linear so it will be increased slowly
